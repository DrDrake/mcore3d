= The `<texture />` element =

The texture element defines the reference to a texture.<br/>
Please notice that the first `<texture />` element occurs in the pass will be bind to texture-unit 0 and so on.

= Attributes =
 * file
  * file name of the texture
  * Syntax: {{{<texture file="../../wood.jpg"/>}}}
  * Values: texture file command (see below)

 * shaderName
  * The name of the texure if it is being referenced in a shader.
  * Syntax: {{{<texture shaderName="diffuseMap"/>}}}
  * Values: "a string"

= Texture file command (in progress) =
Filename(s) in the `<texture />` element is specified by a simple texture file command with the following syntax:<br/><br/>
_{type}_ *:* _{filename1}_ *:* _{filename2}_ *:* _{filename3}_ ... 

 * Loading a 2d texture
  * file="_*2d:*_ ../../wood.jpg"
   * The image "../../wood.jpg" will be loaded as a 2d texture

 * Loading a cubemap texture
  * file="_*cubemap:*_ skybox.jpg"
   * This assumes the image skybox.jpg containing the 6 faces of the cubemap (tiled horizontally: +x -z -x +z +y -y).
   * Please notice the height of image define the cubemap size (must be power of 2) and the width of the image must be equal to 6 times of the height. For example, the image height is 256 pixels, then the image width should be 1536 pixels.

 * Loading a 3d texture
  * file="_*3d:*_tex0.jpg_*;* _tex1.jpg_*;*_ tex2.jpg_*;*_ tex3.jpg_*;*_ tex4.jpg_*;*_ tex5.jpg_*;*_ tex6.jpg_*;*_ tex7.jpg"
   * In the above example, 8 images, "tex0.jpg" ... "tex7.jpg" will be loaded as a 3d texture.
   * If the 8 images have the dimensions of 64 x 64, then the result 3d texture will have a dimension of 64 x 64 x 8 (width x height x depth).
   * Please notice that all images must have the same power-of-2 dimensions.

* If the type is not specified in a texture file command, 2d texture will be assumed.*
