This page describes the mcord3d's material file format. Materials in mcore3d are written in xml format and starts with the `<root />` xml-element.
The `<root />` is composed of:
 * `<merge />`
 * `<pass />`

The [Material_File_Format_Merge `<merge />`] element describes how the current material is combined with other materials.<br/>
The [Material_File_Format_Pass `<pass />`] element corresponds to a rendering pass.<br/>
And there are several [Material_File_Format_Examples example mcore3d material files].<br/>
